# pathways_analysis_reactome

This is a quick code to do enrichment pathways analysis in several sets of genes 
and plot the z-scores of the enrichment in a heatmap.
The new idea here is to create a structure in the visualisation of Reactome pathways - 
this is done using Jaccardi index to check overlap between genes in the pathway.
